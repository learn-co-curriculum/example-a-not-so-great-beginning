Take a look at the opening section of the first Readme on AngularJS:

*Before mainstream JavaScript usage, everything on the client was determined by the server. Routing and views were defined in backend code, meaning view logic was frequently mixed in with business logic, providing the end-user with a poor user experience.

This had its disadvantages, as data displayed on the page could only be updated when the user refreshes. This also meant no smooth transitions between pages.*

### Why Does This Not Work? 

It’s overly technical and dry and especially for a first reading, we need to do a better job of engaging students. Where's the excitement that helps to show why this matters? 

We’re also overloading them with a lot of technical jargon, and you can’t assume that they’ll understand it. Moreover, we’re not giving them any concrete examples of what we’re actually talking about. 

Plus we throw out statements that we don’t really explain. For example, what does it mean that there are “no smooth transitions between pages.”
